<b>SEPIA</b> is a Java library providing tools for the privacy-preserving aggregation of multi-domain
network data. SEPIA applies standard secure multiparty-computation (MPC) techniques to achieve
that. In particular, Shamir’s secret sharing scheme is used to perform computations on private
input data.

A typical deployment scenario for SEPIA involves a number of independent network
domains observed by some type of network probe. This could, for instance, be NetFlow data
export on a router, SNMP inventory data, or IDS alert logs. Although the individual network data
is sensitive and therefore kept secret, network operators would like to aggregrate their data with
the other networks. For example, they might be interested in whether other networks see similar
intrusion alerts or not. Yet, they would never just hand over their alerts to another operator. But if
they knew that indeed, the other guy is likely to be attacked by the same group of hackers, he might
be willing to cooperate in order to come up with a more effective collaborative defense. So what
these operators could do, is installing SEPIA <i>input peers</i> in their premises. These input peers take
sensitive local data and share it over the group of SEPIA privacy peers. The <i>privacy peers</i> (PPs)
together simulate a trusted third party (TTP). That is, each privacy peer gets only one share of each
data item. From this share, the PP cannot derive any information about the original data. Only if a
majority of PPs comes together and combines their shares, they can reconstruct the information.
In addition, the PPs can perform any computation on the shared secrets without reconstructing
intermediate values. When the computation has finished, the PPs reconstruct the final result (for
instance all similar intrusion alerts reported by three or more networks) and distribute it to the input
peers. These will then use this information for improving network management.
